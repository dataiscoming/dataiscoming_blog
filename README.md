# Blog : data Is Coming

![Algorithm schema](./pictures/logo.png)

This project aimed to allow me to progress and discover development of web-app. My first idea was to use Wordpress to create a blog. And it was a good idea actually. But, I wished to practice and code. Then, I decided to begin from the start : Html, css. Then, I added Php, sql and a bit og javascript. Even if I have produced a stable version, this blog is to evolve to test and try other technologies and languages. As a summary, I would say it is like a laboratory, a training project.

## Launch

### Prerequisites

You have to set up the environment for web-development. I propose to use mine, here is the list of software I use :
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as IDE
* [Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/fr/index.html) (with httpd.conf reconfigured)

### Setup

I use Github Desktop to follow the versioning of the project. Then, I switch to VS Code to change the code files. Then, Xampp allow to preview the changes with the Apache HTTP server. But, I cloned the repository into my github folder on my computer. Then, you will need to set up xampp configuration file (httpd.conf) with the path of the github folder to not use the default path : C:\xampp\htdocs ([example](http://www.javadtaghia.com/clam/xampp-linux-windows/howtochangexampplocalhosttoanotherfolderoutsidexamppfolder))  

## Running the tests

## Project status
