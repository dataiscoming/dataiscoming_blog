# Blog : data Is Coming

![Algorithm schema](./pictures/logo.png)

This project aimed to allow me to progress and discover devlopment of web-app. My first idea was to use Wordpress to create a blog. And it was a good idea actually. But, I wished to pratice and code. Then, I decided to begin from the start : Html, css. Then, I added Php, sql and a bit og javascript. Even if I have produced a stable version, this blog is to evovle to test and try other technologies and languages. As a summary, i would say it is as a laboratory, a training project. You are free to use these codes if you need help for coding web-app.
